Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    4
Logic Utilization:
  Total Number Slice Registers:         780 out of  17,344    4%
    Number used as Flip Flops:          724
    Number used as Latches:              56
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             2,353 out of  17,344   13%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,677 out of   8,672   19%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,677 out of   1,677 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,677   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       2,475 out of  17,344   14%
    Number used as logic:             2,353
    Number used as a route-thru:        122

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                139 out of     250   55%
    IOB Flip Flops:                       4
    IOB Latches:                          2
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     2 out of      24    8%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.81
